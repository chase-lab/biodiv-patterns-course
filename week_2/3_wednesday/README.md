# Topic
Dissecting patters of species richness using the MoB approach

## Lecturer
Thore, Shane

## Schedule

### Morning (10:00 - 12:00 AM, lecture and exercises)

How do we measure components of biodiversity using the mob framework? 

* Two-scale approach: metrics derived from the individual-based rarefaction curve at alpha and gamma scale
* Multi-scale approach: differently flavored accumulation curves (capturing N, SAD and intraspecific spatial aggregation)
 

### Afternoon (1:00 - 3:30 PM, practical)

How do components of biodiversity contribute to elevational species richness patters?

* Analysis of a datasets from the literature (group)
* Mini synthesis in class
